#### An online travel diary

## Technologies Used

* C#
* .Net 6
* MSTest
* ASP.Net Core 6 MVC

## Description

### Objectives (MVP)

Make a website where you can enter places you've been to create an online travel diary.

* A place should be represented by a Place class. Begin by giving it the property cityName.

* After testing all model logic and developing controllers and views this application, expand your Place model to include relevant properties like picture(s), how long you stayed, whom you travelled with, a journal entry, and so on. Integrate these into your controllers and views.

* At the very least, this app should include RESTful Index, New, Create, and Show routes for the Place class.
